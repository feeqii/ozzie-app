## 5️⃣ Flutter Project Structure (Clean Architecture)

### Recommended Folder Structure:
```
lib/
├── core/                    # Core utilities used across app
│   ├── constants/          # Colors, text styles, API URLs
│   ├── theme/              # App theme (light/dark)
│   ├── utils/              # Helper functions
│   └── widgets/            # Reusable widgets (buttons, cards)
│

## 7️⃣ Tajweed Explanation (You Asked)

**What is Tajweed?**
Think of it like "pronunciation rules" for the Quran. Just like English has silent letters or sounds that change (like "th" or "ch"), Arabic Quran has special rules for how to pronounce certain letters and words.

**Examples:**
- Some letters should be "thick" sounding
- Some should be "thin"
- Some words have long vowels vs short
- Some have nasal sounds (like saying "n" through your nose)

**Color-Coding**:
Many Quran apps use colors to show these rules:
- 🟦 Blue = Say this thick/heavy
- 🟥 Red = Don't pronounce this letter
- 🟩 Green = Nasal sound
- Etc.

**For Ozzie MVP**:
- ❌ Skip this for now - adds complexity
- ✅ Focus on basic pronunciation accuracy
- 🔮 Add in Phase 2 if beneficial

## 8️⃣ Data Strategy Recommendation

### Hybrid Approach ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**For MVP**:
1. **Hardcode** the 2 Surahs (Al-Fatiha, Al-Ikhlas) in JSON files
2. Design the code to **read from JSON** (not directly in Dart)
3. This gives us:
   - ✅ Fast development (no backend needed)
   - ✅ Offline-first (works without internet)
   - ✅ Easy to expand (just add more JSON files)
   - ✅ Scalable structure (can swap to API later)

**Example JSON Structure**:
```json
{
  "surah_number": 1,
  "surah_name_arabic": "الفاتحة",
  "surah_name_english": "Al-Fatiha",
  "total_verses": 7,
  "verses": [
    {
      "verse_number": 1,
      "arabic_text": "بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ",
      "transliteration": "Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Raheem",
      "translation": "In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.",
      "explanation_for_kids": "This verse is like saying 'I start with Allah's name!' It reminds us that Allah is very kind and caring.",
      "audio_url": "https://everyayah.com/data/Alafasy_128kbps/001001.mp3",
      "words": [
        {
          "arabic": "بِسْمِ",
          "transliteration": "Bismi",
          "meaning": "In the name"
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
