/// üìù WORD MODEL
/// 
/// Represents a single word in a Quranic verse.
/// 
/// WHAT IS THIS?
/// Think of this like a "flashcard" for one Arabic word.
/// It has the Arabic word, how to pronounce it (romanized),
/// and what it means in English.
/// 
/// WHY?
/// - For word-by-word learning
/// - Kids can tap on words to see meanings
/// - Used in word-order quiz games
/// - Helps with understanding, not just memorization
/// 
/// EXAMPLE:
/// Word: ÿ®Ÿêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê
/// Transliteration: Bismi
/// Meaning: In the name
class Word {
  /// The Arabic word (e.g., "ÿ®Ÿêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê")
  final String arabic;
  
  /// How to pronounce it in English letters (e.g., "Bismi")
  final String transliteration;
  
  /// What it means in English (e.g., "In the name")
  final String meaning;
  
  /// Optional: Position in the verse (0, 1, 2...)
  final int? position;

  /// Constructor - how to create a Word
  /// 
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final word = Word(
  ///   arabic: 'ÿ®Ÿêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê',
  ///   transliteration: 'Bismi',
  ///   meaning: 'In the name',
  /// );
  /// ```
  const Word({
    required this.arabic,
    required this.transliteration,
    required this.meaning,
    this.position,
  });

  /// Create a Word from JSON data
  /// 
  /// WHAT IS THIS?
  /// When we get data from an API or file, it comes as JSON (text).
  /// This function converts that JSON into a Word object we can use!
  /// 
  /// Example JSON:
  /// ```json
  /// {
  ///   "arabic": "ÿ®Ÿêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê",
  ///   "transliteration": "Bismi",
  ///   "meaning": "In the name",
  ///   "position": 0
  /// }
  /// ```

    );
  }

  /// Convert a Word to JSON data
  /// 
  /// WHAT IS THIS?
  /// The opposite of fromJson! This converts our Word object
  /// back into JSON so we can save it to a file or send to a server.
  /// 
  /// Example output:
  /// ```json
  /// {
  ///   "arabic": "ÿ®Ÿêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê",
  ///   "transliteration": "Bismi",
  ///   "meaning": "In the name",
  ///   "position": 0
  /// }

  /// 
  /// WHAT IS THIS?
  /// Sometimes you want a new Word that's almost the same,
  /// but with one thing different. This makes that easy!
  /// 
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final newWord = oldWord.copyWith(meaning: 'New meaning');
